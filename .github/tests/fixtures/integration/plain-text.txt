This is a plain text mock file for testing the generic processor with non-JSON content.

It contains multiple lines of text including:
- Special characters: !@#$%^&*()
- Unicode content: Ñiño 测试 🎵 Россия العربية
- Different formatting styles

The content simulates a typical text-based input that might be processed
by the generic processor when no specific JSON structure is available.

This allows testing of:
1. Plain text handling
2. Template substitution with {{content}} placeholder
3. Character encoding preservation
4. Line break handling

End of plain text mock content.
