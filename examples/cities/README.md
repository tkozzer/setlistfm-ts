# Cities Endpoints Examples

This directory contains practical examples demonstrating how to use the setlistfm-ts cities endpoints with automatic rate limiting protection.

## Prerequisites

Before running these examples, you need:

1. **API Key**: Get a free API key from [setlist.fm](https://api.setlist.fm/docs/1.0/index.html)
2. **Environment Setup**: Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API key

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root (`setlistfm-ts/.env`):

```env
SETLISTFM_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

## Rate Limiting Protection

All examples use the new `createSetlistFMClient` which automatically applies **STANDARD rate limiting** (2 requests/second, 1440 requests/day) to protect against accidental API limit violations. The examples display real-time rate limiting status showing:

- Current rate limit profile (STANDARD by default)
- Requests made this second vs. limit
- Requests made today vs. daily limit
- Queue status and retry timing

### Rate Limiting Features

**Default Protection** (used in all examples):

```typescript
const client = createSetlistFMClient({

  apiKey: process.env.SETLISTFM_API_KEY!,
  userAgent: "your-app-name (your-email@example.com)",
  // Automatically uses STANDARD profile: 2 req/sec, 1440 req/day
});
```

**Premium Users** (16 req/sec, 50,000 req/day):

```typescript
const client = createSetlistFMClient({

  apiKey: process.env.SETLISTFM_API_KEY!,
  userAgent: "your-app-name (your-email@example.com)",
  rateLimit: { profile: RateLimitProfile.PREMIUM }
});
```

**Advanced Users** (no rate limiting):

```typescript
const client = createSetlistFMClient({

  apiKey: process.env.SETLISTFM_API_KEY!,
  userAgent: "your-app-name (your-email@example.com)",
  rateLimit: { profile: RateLimitProfile.DISABLED }
});
```

## Available Examples

## Code Structure

Each example follows a consistent pattern with automatic rate limiting:

```typescript
import { createSetlistFMClient } from "../../src/client";
import { getCityByGeoId, searchCities } from "../../src/endpoints/cities";
import "dotenv/config";

async function exampleFunction(): Promise<void> {
  // Create client with automatic STANDARD rate limiting
  const client = createSetlistFMClient({

    apiKey: process.env.SETLISTFM_API_KEY!,
    userAgent: "setlistfm-ts-examples (github.com/tkozzer/setlistfm-ts)",
  });

  // Get HTTP client for endpoint functions
  const httpClient = client.getHttpClient();

  try {
    // Display rate limiting status
    const status = client.getRateLimitStatus();

    console.log(`üìä Rate Limiting: ${status.profile.toUpperCase()} profile`);

    console.log(`üìà Requests: ${status.requestsThisSecond}/${status.secondLimit} this second`);

    // Example implementation with rate limiting protection
    const results = await searchCities(httpClient, { name: "Paris" });

    // Show updated rate limiting status
    const updated = client.getRateLimitStatus();

    console.log(`üìä After request: ${updated.requestsThisSecond}/${updated.secondLimit} requests`);
  }
  catch (error) {
    // Error handling including rate limit errors
  }
}
```

## Learning Path

We recommend running the examples in this order:

1. **Start with `basicCityLookup.ts`** - Learn the fundamentals of city lookup and see rate limiting in action
2. **Try `searchCities.ts`** - Understand search capabilities and rate limiting during multiple requests
3. **Explore `completeExample.ts`** - See advanced workflows and data analysis with intelligent rate limiting

## Key Features Demonstrated

### Rate Limiting Protection

The examples show the new automatic rate limiting features:

- **Default STANDARD profile**: 2 requests/second, 1440 requests/day
- **Real-time monitoring**: Current usage vs. limits displayed
- **Automatic protection**: Prevents accidental API limit violations
- **Queue management**: Handles request pacing automatically
- **Status tracking**: Shows rate limiting throughout workflows

### Geographic Data Handling

The examples show how to work with:

- **Coordinates**: Latitude and longitude processing
- **State codes**: Understanding regional identifiers
- **Country codes**: ISO standard country identification
- **Geographic analysis**: Distance, extremes, and distribution

### Search Capabilities

Learn about the flexible search options:

- **Name searches**: Find cities by partial or exact names
- **Geographic filters**: Search by country code (DE, GB, US), state, or state code
- **Combined criteria**: Use multiple parameters together
- **Pagination**: Navigate through large result sets efficiently

### Data Analysis Techniques

The examples demonstrate:

- Collecting data across multiple pages with rate limiting
- Grouping and categorizing results efficiently
- Statistical analysis of geographic data
- Coordinate range and distribution analysis
- Cross-referencing between search and lookup operations

## Error Handling

All examples include comprehensive error handling for:

- **Rate limiting errors** (429 status) - demonstrates protection working
- Validation errors (invalid geoIds, missing parameters)
- API errors (authentication, not found)
- Network errors (connection issues, timeouts)
- Data processing errors

## Real Geographic Data

These examples use real cities from the setlist.fm database, including:

- **Paris cities worldwide** (184 total) - for search and lookup demonstrations
- **London variations** (133 total) - for international city analysis across 7 countries
- **Major music cities** - Nashville, Austin, Los Angeles, New York
- **Country-specific searches** - Germany (5064 cities), UK (3329 cities), US (10000+ cities)
- **Regional examples** - California (936 cities), New York state (920 cities)

## Performance Considerations

The examples include:

- **Automatic rate limiting**: Built-in protection against API limits
- **Smart pagination**: Efficient data collection with rate limiting awareness
- **Request pacing**: Intelligent delays and queue management
- **Memory management**: Efficient data collection and processing
- **API courtesy**: Automatic rate limiting ensures respectful API usage

## Geographic Insights

Through these examples with rate limiting protection, you'll discover:

- How many cities share common names worldwide (133 Londons across 7 countries)
- Geographic distribution patterns (108 London cities in England alone)
- Coordinate system understanding with real data
- State and country code relationships
- International location data variations

## Troubleshooting

**API Key Issues**:

- Ensure your `.env` file is in the project root
- Verify your API key is correct and active
- Check that `SETLISTFM_API_KEY` matches exactly

**Rate Limiting** (Expected Behavior):

- Examples show rate limiting in action with 429 errors
- This demonstrates the STANDARD profile protection working correctly
- Rate limiting prevents accidental API abuse
- Wait a few seconds between runs if testing multiple examples
- Consider using PREMIUM profile for higher limits if you have access

**Geographic Data Issues**:

- Some cities may have unusual coordinate formats
- State codes vary by country and may be numeric or alpha
- Not all cities have complete geographic information
- Use ISO country codes (DE, GB, US) instead of full country names

**Search Tips**:

- Paris searches return 184 cities worldwide, not just Paris, France
- London searches return 133 cities across 7 countries
- Use country codes to filter by specific countries
- Combine name + country code for more precise results

**Network Issues**:

- Ensure you have an active internet connection
- Check if setlist.fm is accessible from your network
- Verify DNS resolution for api.setlist.fm
