# Venues Endpoints Examples

This directory contains practical examples demonstrating how to use the setlistfm-ts venues endpoints with the new type-safe client and automatic rate limiting protection.

## Prerequisites

Before running these examples, you need:

1. **API Key**: Get a free API key from [setlist.fm](https://api.setlist.fm/docs/1.0/index.html)
2. **Environment Setup**: Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API key

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root (`setlistfm-ts/.env`):

```env
SETLISTFM_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

## Key Features

These examples showcase the **new type-safe client API** with significant improvements:

- **Cleaner syntax**: `client.searchVenues(params)` instead of `searchVenues(httpClient, params)`
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript intellisense and compile-time validation
- **Simplified setup**: No need to manually extract `httpClient`
- **Better error handling**: More descriptive error messages and validation
- **Automatic rate limiting**: Built-in protection with real-time status monitoring

## Rate Limiting Protection

All examples use the new `createSetlistFMClient` which automatically applies **STANDARD rate limiting** (2 requests/second, 1440 requests/day) to protect against accidental API limit violations. The examples display real-time rate limiting status showing:

- Current rate limit profile (STANDARD by default)
- Requests made this second vs. limit
- Requests made today vs. daily limit
- Queue status and rate limiting demonstrations

### Rate Limiting Features

**Default Protection** (used in all examples):

```typescript
const client = createSetlistFMClient({
  apiKey: process.env.SETLISTFM_API_KEY!,
  userAgent: "your-app-name (your-email@example.com)",
  // Automatically uses STANDARD profile: 2 req/sec, 1440 req/day
});
```

**Premium Users** (16 req/sec, 50,000 req/day):

```typescript
const client = createSetlistFMClient({
  apiKey: process.env.SETLISTFM_API_KEY!,
  userAgent: "your-app-name (your-email@example.com)",
  rateLimit: { profile: RateLimitProfile.PREMIUM }
});
```

**Advanced Users** (no rate limiting):

```typescript
const client = createSetlistFMClient({
  apiKey: process.env.SETLISTFM_API_KEY!,
  userAgent: "your-app-name (your-email@example.com)",
  rateLimit: { profile: RateLimitProfile.DISABLED }
});
```

## Code Structure

Each example follows a consistent pattern with the type-safe client:

```typescript
import { createSetlistFMClient } from "../../src/client";
import "dotenv/config";

async function exampleFunction(): Promise<void> {
  // Create client with automatic STANDARD rate limiting
  const client = createSetlistFMClient({
    apiKey: process.env.SETLISTFM_API_KEY!,
    userAgent: "setlistfm-ts-examples (github.com/tkozzer/setlistfm-ts)",
  });

  try {
    // Display rate limiting status
    const status = client.getRateLimitStatus();
    console.log(`üìä Rate Limiting: ${status.profile.toUpperCase()} profile`);

    // Type-safe venue search
    const venues = await client.searchVenues({
      name: "Arena",
      country: "US",
    });

    // Type-safe venue lookup
    if (venues.venue.length > 0) {
      const venueDetails = await client.getVenue(venues.venue[0].id);
      console.log(`Found: ${venueDetails.name}`);

      // Type-safe setlist retrieval
      const setlists = await client.getVenueSetlists(venues.venue[0].id);
      console.log(`Setlists: ${setlists.total}`);
    }
  }
  catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  }
}
```
