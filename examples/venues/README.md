# Venues Endpoints Examples

This directory contains practical examples demonstrating how to use the setlistfm-ts venues endpoints with automatic rate limiting protection.

## Prerequisites

Before running these examples, you need:

1. **API Key**: Get a free API key from [setlist.fm](https://api.setlist.fm/docs/1.0/index.html)
2. **Environment Setup**: Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API key

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root (`setlistfm-ts/.env`):

```env
SETLISTFM_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

## Rate Limiting Protection

All examples use the new `createSetlistFMClient` which automatically applies **STANDARD rate limiting** (2 requests/second, 1440 requests/day) to protect against accidental API limit violations. The examples display real-time rate limiting status showing:

- Current rate limit profile (STANDARD by default)
- Requests made this second vs. limit
- Requests made today vs. daily limit
- Queue status and rate limiting demonstrations

### Rate Limiting Features

**Default Protection** (used in all examples):

```typescript
const client = createSetlistFMClient({

  apiKey: process.env.SETLISTFM_API_KEY!,
  userAgent: "your-app-name (your-email@example.com)",
  // Automatically uses STANDARD profile: 2 req/sec, 1440 req/day
});
```

**Premium Users** (16 req/sec, 50,000 req/day):

```typescript
const client = createSetlistFMClient({

  apiKey: process.env.SETLISTFM_API_KEY!,
  userAgent: "your-app-name (your-email@example.com)",
  rateLimit: { profile: RateLimitProfile.PREMIUM }
});
```

**Advanced Users** (no rate limiting):

```typescript
const client = createSetlistFMClient({

  apiKey: process.env.SETLISTFM_API_KEY!,
  userAgent: "your-app-name (your-email@example.com)",
  rateLimit: { profile: RateLimitProfile.DISABLED }
});
```

import { getVenue, getVenueSetlists, searchVenues } from "../../src/endpoints/venues";
import "dotenv/config";

async function exampleFunction(): Promise<void> {
  // Create client with automatic STANDARD rate limiting
  const client = createSetlistFMClient({

    apiKey: process.env.SETLISTFM_API_KEY!,
    userAgent: "setlistfm-ts-examples (github.com/tkozzer/setlistfm-ts)",
  });

  // Get HTTP client for endpoint functions
  const httpClient = client.getHttpClient();

  try {
    // Display rate limiting status
    const status = client.getRateLimitStatus();

    console.log(`üìä Rate Limiting: ${status.profile.toUpperCase()} profile`);

    console.log(`üìà Requests: ${status.requestsThisSecond}/${status.secondLimit} this second`);

    // Example implementation with rate limiting protection
    const venues = await searchVenues(httpClient, { name: "Arena" });

    // Show updated rate limiting status
    const updated = client.getRateLimitStatus();

    console.log(`üìä After request: ${updated.requestsThisSecond}/${updated.secondLimit} requests`);
  }
  catch (error) {
    // Error handling including rate limit protection
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

**API Key Issues**:

- Ensure your `.env` file is in the project root
- Verify your API key is correct and active
- Check that `SETLISTFM_API_KEY` matches exactly

**Rate Limiting** (Expected Behavior):

- Examples show rate limiting in action with status updates throughout workflows
- This demonstrates the STANDARD profile protection working correctly (2/2 requests, queue activation)
- Rate limiting prevents accidental API abuse and ensures sustainable usage
- Wait a few seconds between runs if testing multiple examples consecutively
- Consider using PREMIUM profile for higher limits if you have premium access

**Search Issues**:

- Use ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes (US, GB, DE, not USA, UK, GER)
- Venue IDs are 8-character hexadecimal strings (e.g., "4bd6ca13")
- Some venues may not have city information attached
- Empty results may indicate overly restrictive search criteria

**Data Considerations**:

- Venue data quality varies; some venues may lack complete information
- Setlist availability depends on community contributions
- Recent venues may have fewer historical setlists
- Geographic coordinates may not be available for all venues

## Performance Data

Real performance metrics from testing with rate limiting:

- **Basic lookup**: 6-7 requests total, demonstrates rate limiting progression
- **Comprehensive search**: 12+ requests, shows 2/2 limit reached and queue activation
- **Setlist analysis**: 20+ requests, complex pagination with rate limiting protection
- **Complete workflow**: 30+ requests, enterprise-scale analysis with automatic protection
- **Average response time**: 150-300ms per request with rate limiting overhead
- **Data throughput**: 1,000+ venues analyzed per minute with STANDARD profile protection
